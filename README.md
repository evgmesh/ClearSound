ClearSound Smart Speaker System

ClearSound started as a project envisioning more efficient and user-friendly PA system. Utilising smart technology and cloud intercommunication to create a new generation of PA systems. ClearSound responds to properties of the acoustic space by incorporating measurement data into a self-optimizing DSP algorithm, which is implemented by measuring the impulse response and noise properties of the surrounding space of the speaker.
