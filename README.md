ClearSound Smart Speaker System

ClearSound started as a project envisioning more efficient and user-friendly PA system utilising smart technology and intercommunication to and from the cloud. Physical properties of the acoustic space are incorporated into a self-optimizing DSP algorithm, by measuring the impulse response and noise properties of the surrounding space of the speaker.
